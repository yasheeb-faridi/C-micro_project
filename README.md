This is a micro project that is created by Yasheeb Faridi.

According to this

/*The Electricity Bill Calculator is an application-based micro project that calculates
the month’s electricity bill based on the appliances or loads and units consumed.
People who do not have a technical understanding of calculating power bills can use
this program to forecast/calculate their electricity bills. The application should have
the following features:
 To display the Meter Number
 To display the previous meter reading
 Facility to enter present meter-reading
 To display the no. of units consumed
 To display the complete Tariff Structure (Domestic, Non-Domestic, Industrial)
 Provision to input the no. of units consumed per month
 To display the bill-amount payable as per the tariff structure
 To display the due date of the payment*/



Note:   There is a compiled file named ElectricityBill whene I compiled and run from VS code.
	And   a.out file is created when I run the "gcc electricityBill.c" command on terminal
